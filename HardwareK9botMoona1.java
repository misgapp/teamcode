/**
 * This is NOT an opmode.
 *
 * This class can be used to define all the specific hardware for a single robot.
 * In this case that robot is a K9 robot.
 *
 * This hardware class assumes the following device names have been configured on the robot:
 * Note:  All names are lower case and some have single spaces between words.
 *
 * Motor channel:  Left  drive motor:        "left_drive"
 * Motor channel:  Right drive motor:        "right_drive"
 * Servo channel:  Servo to raise/lower arm: "arm"
 * Servo channel:  Servo to open/close claw: "claw"
 *
 * Note: the configuration of the servos is such that:
 *   As the arm servo approaches 0, the arm position moves up (away from the floor).
 *   As the claw servo approaches 0, the claw opens up (drops the game element).
